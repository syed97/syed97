## Hi, welcome to my profile!

I'm Hamza, a software engineer interested in full stack development and data engineering. 

### About
I am currently working as a data engineer with Python and cloud computing technologies like GCP and AWS. I'm also learning more about Django and Flask in order to develop data-centric web apps. Besides this, I am also interested in experimental technoglies and interactive hardware-software systems.
