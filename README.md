## Hi, welcome to my profile!

I'm Hamza, a software engineer interested in full stack development and data engineering. 

### About
I am currently pursuing a Master's program in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. Open to research and open source software and data engineering collaborations.

My past experience involves working as a data engineer with Python and cloud computing technologies like GCP and AWS. I'm also pursuing projects in Django and Flask in order to productionalize data science solutions thorugh data-centric web apps. Besides this, I also tinker with IoT based projects and interactive hardware-software systems.
